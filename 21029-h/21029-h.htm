SIR CECIL SPRING-RICE</a></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="cap">S</span>TEADFAST as any soldier of the line</p>
<p class="large">He served his England, with the imminent death</p>
<p>Poised at his heart. Nor could the world divine</p>
<p class="large b">The constant peril of each burdened breath.</p>

<p>England, and the honour of England, he still served</p>
<p class="large">Walking the strict path, with the old high pride</p>
<p>Of those invincible knights who never swerved</p>
<p class="large b">One hair's breadth from the way until they died.</p>

<p>Quietness he loved, and books, and the grave beauty</p>
<p class="large">Of England's Helicon, whose eternal light</p>
<p>Shines like a lantern on that road of duty,</p>
<p class="large b">Discerned by few in this chaotic night.</p>

<p>And his own pen, foretelling his release,</p>
<p class="b">Told us that he foreknew "the end was peace."</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>II.</h3>

<div class="ml">
<p>Soldier of England, he shall live unsleeping</p>
<p class="large">Among his friends, with the old proud flag above;</p>
<p>For even today her honour is in his keeping.</p>
<p class="large b">He has joined the hosts that guard her with their love.</p>

<p>They shine like stars, unnumbered happy legions,</p>
<p class="large">In that high realm where all our darkness dies.</p>
<p>He moves, with honour, in those loftier regions,</p>
<p class="b">Above this "world of passion and of lies":</p>

<p>For so he called it, keeping his own pure passion</p>
<p class="large">A silent flame before the true and good;</p>
<p>Not fawning on the throng in this world's fashion</p>
<p class="b">come and see what all might see who would.</p>

<p>Soldier of England, brave and gentle knight,</p>
<p class="b">The soul of Sidney welcomes you tonight.</p>

<div class="ml">
<p><span class="cap">T</span>HIS is the song of the wind as it came</p>
<p class="b">Tossing the flags of the nations to flame:</p>

<p class="large"><i>I am the breath of God. I am His laughter.</i></p>
<p class="b"><i>I am His Liberty. That is my name.</i></p>

<p>So it descended, at night, on the city.</p>
<p>So it went lavishing beauty and pity,</p>
<p>Lighting the lordliest street of the world</p>
<p>With half of the banners that earth has unfurled;</p>
<p>Over the lamps that are brighter than stars.</p>
<p>Laughing aloud on its way to the wars,</p>
<p>Proud as America, sweeping along</p>
<p>Death and destruction like notes in a song,</p>
<p>Leaping to battle as man to his mate,</p>
<p>Joyous as God when he moved to create,&mdash;</p>
<p class="large">Never was voice of a nation so glorious,</p>

<p>Here, in a league that our blindness and pride</p>

<p>That is America, speaking one tongue,</p>

<p>Forty-eight States that are empires in might,</p>

<p>Nerved as one body, with net-works of steel,</p>
<p>Merging their strength in the one Commonweal,</p>
<p>Brooking no poverty, mocking at Mars,</p>
<p>Building their cities to talk with the stars.</p>
<p>Thriving, increasing by myriads again</p>
<p>Till even in numbers old Europe may wane.</p>
<p>How shall a son of the England they fought</p>
<p>Fail to declare the full pride of his thought,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>Stand with the scoffers who, year after year,</p>

<p class="large"><i>I am the breath of God. I am His laughter.</i></p>
<p class="b"><i>I am His Liberty. That is my name.</i></p>

<p>Flags, in themselves, are but rags that are dyed.</p>
<p>Flags, in that wind, are like nations enskied.</p>
<p>See, how they grapple the night as it rolls</p>
<p>And trample it under like triumphing souls.</p>
<p>Over the city that never knew sleep,</p>
<p>Look at the riotous folds as they leap.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Thousands of tri-colors, laughing for France,</p>
<p>Ripple and whisper and thunder and dance;</p>
<p>Thousands of flags for Great Britain aflame</p>
<p>Answer their sisters in Liberty's name.</p>
<p>Belgium is burning in pride overhead.</p>
<p>Poland is near, and her sunrise is red.</p>
<p>Under and over, and fluttering between,</p>
<p>Italy burgeons in red, white, and green.</p>
<p>See, how they climb like adventurous flowers,</p>
<p>Over the tops of the terrible towers....</p>
<p><i>There, in the darkness, the glories are mated.</i></p>
<p><i>There, in the darkness, a world is created.</i></p>
<p><i>There, in this Pentecost, streaming on high.</i></p>
<p><i>There, with a glory of stars in the sky.</i></p>
<p><i>There the broad flag of our union and liberty</i></p>

<p class="large">Each one of us remembering his own dead.</p>
<p>A more than earthly beauty seemed to brood</p>
<p class="large b">On that hushed throng, and bless each bending head.</p>

<p>Beautiful on that gold, the deep-sea blue</p>

<p class="large b">Deep, as for wings&mdash;Oh, deep as England's pride.</p>

<p>There were no trumpets blown for victory.</p>
<p class="large b">A million dead were calling us that day.</p>

<p>And eyes grew blind, at times; but grief was deep,</p>
<p class="large">Deeper than any foes or friends have known;</p>
<p>For Oh, my country's lips are locked to keep</p>

<p class="large b">We heard the tread of all those phantom feet.</p>

<p>Yes. There was victory! Deep in every soul.</p>

<p class="large">The Cross that fell with all those glorious towers,</p>
<p>Burnt black in France or mocked on Calvary,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>Legions of small white crosses, mile on mile,</p>

<p>Out of the world's Walpurgis, where hope perished,</p>

<p class="large">In form and thought and act; and still must shame us</p>

<p class="large b">And yet let slip the shining hands that claim us.</p>

<p>O, if this Love might cloak with rags His glory,</p>
<p>Laugh, eat and drink, and dwell with suffering men,</p>

<p class="large b">This world&mdash;we thought&mdash;might be transfigured then.</p>

<p>"But Oh," Love answered, with swift human tears,</p>
<p class="b">"All these things have I done, these many years."</p>
</div>

<p>"This day," Love said, "if ye will hear my voice;</p>

<p class="large">Where, under those high, austere, implacable stars,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>They saw the ferry-boats, <i>Iris</i> and <i>Daffodil</i>, creeping</p>
<p class="large">Darkly as clouds to the shimmering mine-strewn bars,</p>
<p class="indent">Flash into light!</p>
<p class="indent b">Then thunder reddened the night.</p>

<p>The wild white swords of the search-lights blinded and stabbed them,</p>
<p class="large">The sharp black shadows fought in fantastic wars.</p>
<p class="indent">Black waves leapt whitening,</p>
<p class="indent b">Red decks were washed with lightning.</p>

<p>But, under the twelve-inch guns of the black land-batteries</p>
<p class="large">The hacked bright hulk, in a glory of crackling spars,</p>
<p class="indent">Moved to her goal</p>
<p class="indent b">Like an immortal soul;</p>

<p>That, while the raw rent flesh in a furnace is tortured,</p>
<p class="large">Reigns by a law no agony ever can shake,</p>

<p class="indent b">Above all shocks of the hour.</p>

<p class="large">The old broken ship that the enemy never could break,</p>
<p class="indent">Swept through the fire</p>
<p class="indent b">And grappled her heart's desire.</p>

<p>There, on a wreck that blazed with the soul of England,</p>
<p class="large">The lads that died in the dark for England's sake</p>
<p class="indent">Knew, as they died,</p>
<p class="indent b">Nelson was at their side;</p>

<p>Nelson, and all the ghostly fleets of his island,</p>
<p class="large">Fighting beside them there, and the soul of Drake!&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">Dreams, as we knew,</p>
<p class="indent b">Till these lads made them true.</p>

<p><i>How should we praise you, lads of the old Vindictive,</i></p>
<p class="large"><i>Who looked death straight in the eyes,</i></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Till his gaze fell</i></p>
<p class="indent"><i>In those red gates of hell?</i></p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span><a href="#contents">THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM</a></h2>
<div class="ml">
<p><span class="cap">W</span>HEN hawthorn buds are creaming white,</p>
<p class="large">And the red foolscap all stuck with may,</p>
<p>Then lasses walk with eyes alight,</p>
<p class="large b">And it's chimney-sweepers' dancing day.</p>

<p>For the chimney-sweeps of Cheltenham town,</p>
<p class="large">Sooty of face as a swallow of wing,</p>
<p>Come whistling, singing, dancing down</p>
<p class="large b">With white teeth flashing as they sing.</p>

<p>And Jack-in-the green, by a clown in blue,</p>
<p class="large">Walks like a two-legged bush of may,</p>
<p>With the little wee lads that wriggled up the flue</p>
<p class="large b">Ere Cheltenham town cried "dancing day."</p>

<p>For brooms were short and the chimneys tall,</p>
<p class="large">And the gipsies caught 'em these blackbirds cheap,</p>
<p>So Cheltenham bought them, spry and small,</p>
<p class="large b">And shoved them up in the dark to sweep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>For Cheltenham town was cruel of old,</p>
<p class="large">But she has been gathering garlands gay,</p>
<p>And the little wee lads are in green and gold,</p>
<p class="large b">For it's chimney-sweepers' dancing day.</p>

<p>And red as a rose, and blue as the sky,</p>
<p class="large">With teeth as white as their faces are black,</p>
<p>The master-sweeps go dancing by,</p>
<p class="large b">With a gridiron painted on every back.</p>

<p>But when they are ranged in the market-place,</p>
<p class="large">The clown's wife comes with an iron spoon,</p>
<p>And cozens a penny for her sweet face</p>
<p class="large b">To keep their golden throats in tune.</p>

<p>Then, hushing the riot of that mad throng,</p>
<p class="large">And sweet as the voice of a long-dead May,</p>
<p>A wandering pedlar lifts 'em a song,</p>
<p class="large b">Of chimney-sweepers' dancing day;</p>

<p>And the sooty faces, they try to recall....</p>
<p class="large">As they gather around in their spell-struck rings....</p>
<p>But nobody knows that singer at all</p>
<p class="large b">Or the curious old-time air he sings:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>Why are you dancing, O chimney-sweeps of Cheltenham,</p>
<p class="large">And where did you win you these may-coats so fine;</p>
<p>For some are red as roses, and some are gold as daffodils,</p>
<p class="large b">But who, ah, who remembers, now, a little lad of mine?</p>

<p>Lady, we are dancing, as we danced in old England</p>
<p class="large">When the may was more than may, very long ago:</p>
<p>As for our may-coats, it was your white hands, lady,</p>
<p class="large b">Filled our sooty hearts and minds with blossom, white as snow.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful face we saw, wandering through Cheltenham.</p>
<p class="large">It was a beautiful song we heard, very far away,</p>
<p>Weeping for a little lad stolen by the gipsies,</p>
<p class="large b">Broke our hearts and filled 'em with the glory of the may.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>Many a little lad had we, chirruping in the chimney-tops,</p>
<p class="large">Twirling out a sooty broom, a blot against the blue.</p>
<p>Ah, but when we called to him, and when he saw and ran to her,</p>
<p class="large b">All our winter ended, and our world was made anew.</p>

<p>Then she gave us may-coats of gold and green and crimson,</p>
<p class="large">Then, with a long garland, she led our hearts away,</p>
<p>Whispering, "Remember, though the boughs forget the hawthorn,</p>
<p class="large b">Yet shall I return to you, that was your lady May."&mdash;</p>

<p>But why are you dancing now, O chimney-sweeps of Cheltenham,</p>
<p class="large">And why are you singing of a May that is fled?&mdash;</p>
<p>O, there's music to be born, though we pluck the old fiddle-strings,</p>
<p class="large b">And a world's May awaking where the fields lay dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>And we dance, dance, dreaming of a lady most beautiful</p>
<p class="large">That shall walk the green valleys of this dark earth one day,</p>
<p>And call to us gently, "O chimney-sweeps of Cheltenham,</p>
<p class="large">I am looking for my children. Awake, and come away."</p>

<div class="ml">
<p><i><span class="cap">T</span>HE old gentleman, tapping his amber snuff-box</i></p>
<p><i>(A heart-shaped snuff-box with a golden clasp)</i></p>
<p><i>Stared at the dying fire. "I'd like them all</i></p>

<p><i>"But how to do it delicately! I can't</i></p>

<p><i>And, to be sure that Rosalind reads it through,</i></p>
<p><i>I'll make it an appendix to my will!"</i></p>
<p><i>&mdash;Still cynical, you see. He couldn't help it.</i></p>
<p><i>He had seen much, felt much. He snapped the snuff box,</i></p>
<p><i>Shook his white periwig, trimmed a long quill pen,</i></p>
<p><i>And then began to write, most carefully,</i></p>
<p class="b"><i>These couplets, in the old heroic style:&mdash;</i></p>

<p>O, had I known in boyhood, only known</p>
<p>The few sad truths that time has made my own,</p>
<p>I had not lost the best that youth can give,</p>
<p>Nay, life itself, in learning how to live.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>This laboring heart would not be tired so soon,</p>
<p>This jaded blood would jog to a livelier tune:</p>
<p>And some few friends, could I begin again,</p>
<p>Should know more happiness, and much less pain.</p>
<p>I should not wound in ignorance, nor turn</p>
<p>In foolish pride from those for whom I yearn.</p>
<p>I should have kept nigh half the friends I've lost,</p>
<p class="b">And held for dearest those I wronged the most.</p>

<p>Yet, when I see more cunning men evade</p>
<p>With colder tact, the blunders that I made;</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if the better part</p>
<p>Is not still mine, who lacked their subtle art.</p>
<p>For I have conned my book in harsher schools,</p>
<p>And learned from struggling what they worked by rules;</p>
<p>Learned&mdash;with some pain&mdash;more quickly to forgive</p>
<p>My fellow-blunderers, while they learn to live;</p>
<p>Learned&mdash;with some tears&mdash;to keep a steadfast mind,</p>
<p class="b">And think more kindly of my own poor kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span><i>He read the verses through, shaking his wig.</i></p>
<p><i>"Perhaps ... perhaps"&mdash;he whispered to himself,</i></p>

<p><i>But Rosalind never; nor that nephew of mine,</i></p>
<p><i>The witty politician. No. No. No.</i></p>
<p><i>They'd say my mind was wandering, I'm afraid."</i></p>
<p><i>So, with a frozen face, reluctantly,</i></p>
<p><i>He tossed his verses into the dying fire,</i></p>
<p><i>And watched the sparks fly upward.</i></p>
<p class="indent3"><i>There, at dawn,</i></p>
<p><i>They found him, cold and stiff by the cold hearth,</i></p>
<p><i>His amber snuff-box in his ivory hand.</i></p>
<p><i>"You see," they said, "he never needed friends.</i></p>
<p><i>He had that curious antique frozen way.</i></p>
<p><i>He had no heart&mdash;only an amber snuff-box.</i></p>
<p class="b"><i>He died quite happily, taking a pinch of snuff."</i></p>

<p><i>His nephew, that engaging politician,</i></p>
<p><i>Inherited the snuff-box, and remarked</i></p>

<h5>(<i>An epistle from a narrow-minded old gentleman to a young artist of
superior intellect and intense realism.</i>)</h5>
<div class="ml">
<p><span class="cap">Y</span>OUR thoughts are for the poor and weak?</p>
<p class="large">Ah, no, the picturesque's your passion!</p>
<p>Your tongue is always in your cheek</p>
<p class="large b">At poverty that's not in fashion.</p>

<p>You like a ploughman's rugged face,</p>
<p class="large">Or painted eyes in Piccadilly;</p>
<p>But bowler hats are commonplace,</p>
<p class="large b">And thread-bare tradesmen simply silly.</p>

<p>The clerk that sings "God save the King,"</p>
<p class="large">And still believes his Tory paper,&mdash;</p>
<p>You hate the an&aelig;mic fool? I thought</p>
<p class="large b">You loved the weak! Was that all vapour?</p>

<p>Ah, when you sneer, dear democrat,</p>
<p class="large">At such a shiny-trousered Tory</p>
<p>Because he doffs his poor old hat</p>
<p class="large b">To what he thinks his country's glory,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>To you it's just a coloured rag.</p>
<p class="large">You hate the "patriots" that bawl so.</p>
<p>Well, my Ulysses, there's a flag</p>
<p class="large b">That lifts men in Republics also.</p>

<p>No doubt his thoughts are cruder far;</p>
<p class="large">And, where those linen folds are shaking,</p>
<p>Perhaps he sees a kind of star</p>
<p class="large b">Because his eyes are tired and aching.</p>

<p>Banal enough! Banal as truth!</p>
<p class="large">But I'm not thinking of his banners.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of his pinched white youth</p>
<p class="large b">And your disgusting "new art" manners.</p>

<p>His meek submission stirs your hate?</p>
<p class="large">Better, my lad, if you're so fervent,</p>
<p>Turn your cold steel against the State</p>
<p class="large b">Instead of sneering at the servant.</p>

<p>He does his job. He draws his pay.</p>
<p class="large">You sneer, and dine with those that pay him;</p>
<p>And then you write a snobbish play</p>
<p class="large b">For democrats, in which you play him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Ah, yes, you like simplicity</p>
<p class="large">That sucks its cheeks to make the dimple.</p>
<p>But this domestic bourgeoisie</p>
<p class="large b">You hate,&mdash;because it's all too simple.</p>

<p>You hate the hearth, the wife, the child,</p>
<p class="large">You hate the heavens that bend above them.</p>
<p>Your simple folk must all run wild</p>
<p class="large b">Like jungle-beasts before you love them.</p>

<p>You own a house in Cheyne Walk,</p>
<p class="large">(You say it costs three thousand fully)</p>
<p>Where subtle snobs can talk and talk</p>
<p class="large b">And play the intellectual bully.</p>

<p>Yes. I say "snobs." Are names alone</p>
<p class="large">Free from all change? Your word "Victorian"</p>
<p>Could bite and sting in ninety one</p>
<p class="large b">But now&mdash;it's deader than the saurian.</p>

<p>You think I live in yesterday,</p>
<p class="large">Because I think your way the wrong one;</p>
<p>But I have hewed and ploughed my way,</p>
<p class="large b">And&mdash;unlike yours&mdash;it's been a long one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>I let Victoria toll her bell,</p>
<p class="large">And went with Strindberg for a ride, sir.</p>

<p class="large b">And come out on the other side, sir,&mdash;</p>

<p>The further side, the morning side,</p>
<p class="large">I read free verse (the Psalms) on Sunday.</p>
<p>But I've decided (you'll decide)</p>
<p class="large b">That there is room for song on Monday.</p>

<p>I've seen the new snob on his way,</p>
<p class="large">The intellectual snob I mean, sir,</p>
<p>The artist snob, in book and play,</p>
<p class="large b">Kicking his mother round the scene, sir.</p>

<p>I've heard the Tories talk like fools;</p>
<p class="large">And the rich fool that apes the Tory.</p>
<p>I've seen the shopmen break your rules</p>
<p class="large b">And die like Christ, in Christ's own glory.</p>

<p>But, as for you, that liberal sneer</p>
<p class="large">Reminds me of the poor old Kaiser.</p>
<p>He was a "socialist," my dear.</p>
<p class="large">Well, I'm your grandson. You'll grow wiser.</p>

<h5>(Written after hearing a line of Keats repeated by a passing stranger under the palms of Southern California.)</h5>

<div class="ml">
<p><span class="cap">U</span>NDER the palms of San Diego</p>
<p class="large">Where gold-skinned Mexicans loll at ease,</p>
<p>And the red half-moons of their black-pipped melons</p>
<p class="large">Drop from their hands in the sunset seas,</p>
<p>And an incense, out of the old brown missions,</p>
<p class="large b">Blows through the orange trees;</p>

<p>I wished that a poet who died in Europe</p>
<p class="large">Had found his way to this rose-red West;</p>
<p>That Keats had walked by the wide Pacific</p>
<p class="large">And cradled his head on its healing breast,</p>
<p>And made new songs of the sun-burned sea-folk,</p>
<p class="large b">New poems, perhaps his best.</p>

<p>I thought of him, under the ripe pomegranates</p>
<p class="large">At the desert's edge, where the grape-vines grow,</p>
<p>In a sun-kissed ranch between grey-green sage-brush</p>
<p class="large">And amethyst mountains, peaked with snow,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>Or watching the lights of the City of Angels</p>
<p class="large b">Glitter like stars below.</p>

<p>He should walk, at dawn, by the lemon orchards,</p>
<p class="large">And breathe at ease in that dry bright air;</p>
<p>And the Spanish bells in their crumbling cloisters</p>
<p class="large">Of brown adobe would sing to him there;</p>
<p>And the old Franciscans would bring him their baskets</p>
<p class="large b">Of apple and olive and pear.</p>

<p>And the mandolins, in the deep blue twilight,</p>
<p class="large">Under that palm with the lion's mane,</p>
<p>Would pluck, once more, at his golden heart-strings,</p>
<p class="large">And tell him the old sea-tales of Spain;</p>
<p>And there should the daughters of Hesperus teach him</p>
<p class="large b">Their mystical songs again.</p>

<h4>(<i>On Certain Realists.</i>)</h4>

<div class="ml">

<p><span class="cap">Y</span>OU with the quick sardonic eye</p>
<p>For all the mockeries of life,</p>
<p>Beware, in this dark masque of things that seem,</p>
<p>Lest even that tragic irony,</p>
<p>Which you discern in this our mortal strife,</p>
<p class="b">Trick you and trap you, also, with a dream.</p>

<p>Last night I saw a dead man borne along</p>
<p>The city streets, passing a boisterous throng</p>
<p>That never ceased to laugh and shout and dance:</p>
<p>And yet, and yet,</p>
<p>For all the poison bitter minds might brew</p>
<p>From themes like this, I knew</p>
<p>That the stern Truth would not permit her glance</p>
<p>Thus to be foiled by flying straws of chance,</p>
<p>For her keen eyes on deeper skies are set,</p>
<p class="b">And laws that tragic ironists forget.</p>

<p>She saw the dead man's life, from birth to death,&mdash;</p>
<p>All that he knew of love and sin and pain,</p>
<p>Success and failure (not as this world sees),</p>
<p>His doubts, his passions, inner loss and gain,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>And borne on darker tides of constant law</p>
<p>Beyond the margin of this life she saw</p>
<p>All that had left his body with the breath.</p>
<p class="b">These things, to her, were still realities.</p>

<p>If any mourned for him unseen,</p>
<p>She saw them, too.</p>
<p>If none, she'd not pretend</p>
<p>His clay were colder, or his God less true,</p>
<p>Or that his grave, at length, would be less green.</p>
<p>She'd not deny</p>
<p>The boundless depths of her eternal sky</p>
<p>Brooding above a boundless universe,</p>
<p>Because he seemed to man's unseeing eye</p>
<p>Going a little further to fare worse;</p>
<p>Nor would she assume he lacked that unseen friend</p>
<p>Whom even the tragic ironists declare</p>
<p class="b">Were better than the seen, in his last end.</p>

<p>Oh, then, beware, beware,</p>
<p>Lest in the strong name of "reality"</p>
<p>You mock yourselves anew with shapes of air,</p>
<p>Lest it be you, agnostics, who re-write</p>
<p>The fettering creeds of night,</p>
<p>Affirm you know your own Unknowable,</p>
<p>And lock the wing&eacute;d soul in a new hell;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>Lest it be you, lip-worshippers of Truth,</p>
<p>Who break the heart of youth;</p>
<p>Lest it be you, the realists, who fight</p>
<p>With shadows, and forget your own pure light;</p>
<p>Lest it be you who, with a little shroud</p>
<p>Snatched from the sightless faces of the dead,</p>
<p>Hoodwink the world, and keep the mourner bowed</p>
<p>In dust, real dust, with stones, real stones, for bread;</p>
<p>Lest, as you look one eighth of an inch beneath</p>
<p>The yellow skin of death,</p>
<p>You dream yourselves discoverers of the skull</p>
<p>That old <i>memento mori</i> of our faith;</p>
<p>Lest it be you who hunt a flying wraith</p>
<p>Through this dissolving stuff of hill and cloud;</p>
<p>Lest it be you, who, at the last, annul</p>
<p>Your covenant with your kind;</p>
<p>Lest it be you who darken heart and mind,</p>
<p>Sell the strong soul in bondage to a dream,</p>
<p class="b">And fetter us once more to things that seem.</p>

<h4>(<i>An Answer</i>)</h4>


<p class="none b" style="font-size: 95%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify;">[After reading an article in a leading London journal by an
"intellectual" who attacked one of the noblest poets and greatest
artists of a former century (or any century) on the ground that his
high ethical standards were incompatible with the new lawlessness.
This vicious lawlessness the writer described definitely, and he paid
his tribute to dishonour as openly and brutally as any of the Bolsheviki
could have done. I had always known that this was the real
ground of the latter-day onslaught on some of the noblest literature
of the past; but I had never seen it openly confessed before. The
time has now surely come when, if our civilization is to make any
fight at all against the new "red ruin and breaking up of laws," we
must cease to belaud our slack-minded, latter-day "literature of
rebellion" for its cleverness in making scraps of paper out of the
plain laws of right and wrong. It has been doing this for more than
twenty-five years, and the same has become fashionable among
those who are too busy to read carefully or understand fully what
pitfalls are being prepared for their own feet and the feet of their children.]</p>

<div class="ml">
<p><span class="cap">I</span>F this were true, England indeed were dead.</p>
<p class="large">If the wild fashion of that poisonous hour</p>
<p class="large">Wherein the new Salome, clothed with power,</p>
<p>Wriggled and hissed, with hands and feet so red,</p>
<p>Should even now demand that glorious head,</p>
<p class="large">Whose every word was like an English flower,</p>
<p class="large">Whose every song an English April shower,</p>
<p>Whose every thought immortal wine and bread;</p>
<p>If this were true, if England should prefer</p>
<p class="large">Darkness, corruption, and the adulterous crew,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>Shakespeare and Browning would cry shame on her,</p>
<p class="large">And Milton would deny the land he knew;</p>
<p>And those who died in Flanders yesterday</p>
<p class="b">Would thank their God they sleep in cleaner clay.</p>
</div>

<h3>II</h3>
<div class="ml">
<p>It is not true. Only these "rebel" wings,</p>
<p class="large">These glittering clouds of "intellectual" flies</p>
<p class="large">Out of the stagnant pools of midnight rise</p>
<p>From the old dead creeds, with carrion-poisoned stings</p>
<p class="large">They strike at noble and ignoble things,</p>
<p class="large">Immortal Love with the old world's out-worn lies,</p>
<p class="large">But even now, a wind from clearer skies</p>
<p class="b">Dissolves in smoke their coteries and wings.</p>

<p>See, their divorced idealist re-divorces</p>
<p class="large">The wife he stole from his own stealing friend!</p>
<p>And <i>these</i> would pluck the high stars from their courses,</p>
<p class="large">And mock the fools that praise them, till the end!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>Well, let the whole world praise them. Truth can wait</p>
<p class="b">Till our new England shall unlock the gate.</p>
</div>

<h3>III</h3>
<div class="ml">
<p>Yes. Let the fools go paint themselves with woad,</p>
<p class="large">For we've a jest between us, Truth and I.</p>
<p class="large">We know that those who live by fashion die</p>
<p>Also by fashion, and that mode kills mode.</p>
<p>We know the great new age is on the road,</p>
<p class="large">And death is at the heart of every lie.</p>
<p class="large">But we've a jest between us, Truth and I.</p>
<p class="b">And we have locked the doors to our abode.</p>

<p>Yet if some great new "rebel" in his pride</p>
<p class="large">Should pass that way and hear us laughing low</p>
<p>Like lovers, in the darkness, side by side,</p>
<p class="large">He might catch this:&mdash;"The dullards do not know</p>
<p>That names are names. New 'rebel' is old 'thrall.'"</p>
<p>And we're the lonely dreamers after all.</p>

<p>She plucked him off, she lifted him high,</p>
<p class="b">Like rose-red fruit on the blue sky.</p>

<p>She pressed her lips to the budded feet,</p>
<p class="b">And murmured softly, "<i>Oh, sweet, my sweet.</i>"</p>

<p>She whispered, "<i>Gods, that my land may live,</i></p>
<p class="b"><i>I give the best that I have to give!</i>"</p>

<p>Then, then, before the throng awoke,</p>
<p class="b">Before one cry from their white lips broke,</p>

<p>She tossed him into the fiery flood,</p>
<p class="b">Her child, her baby, her flesh and blood.</p>

<p>And the crisp hissing waves closed round</p>
<p class="b">And melted him through without a sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>"<i>Too quick for pain</i>," they heard her say,</p>

<h4>(1904)</h4>

<div class="ml">

<p><span class="cap">T</span>HE sunset lingered in the pale green West:</p>
<p class="large">In rosy wastes the low soft evening star</p>
<p>Woke; while the last white sea-mew sought for rest;</p>
<p class="large b">And tawny sails came stealing o'er the bar.</p>

<p>But, in the hillside cottage, through the panes</p>
<p class="large">The light streamed like a thin far trumpet-call,</p>
<p>And quickened, as with quivering battle-stains,</p>
<p class="large b">The printed ships that decked the parlour wall.</p>

<p>From oaken frames old admirals looked down:</p>
<p class="large">They saw the lonely slumberer at their feet:</p>
<p>They saw the paper, headed <i>Talk from Town;</i></p>
<p class="large b"><i>Our rusting trident, and our phantom fleet</i>:</p>

<p>And from a neighbouring tavern surged a song</p>
<p class="large">Of England laughing in the face of war,</p>
<p>With eyes unconquerably proud and strong,</p>
<p class="large b">And lips triumphant from her Trafalgar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>But he, the slumberer in that glimmering room,</p>
<p class="large">Saw distant waters glide and heave and gleam;</p>
<p>Around him in the softly coloured gloom</p>
<p class="large b">The pictures clustered slowly to a dream.</p>

<p>He saw how England, resting on her past,</p>
<p class="large">Among the faded garlands of her dead,</p>
<p>Woke; for a whisper reached her heart at last,</p>
<p class="large b">And once again she raised her steel-clad head.</p>

<p>Her eyes were filled with sudden strange alarms;</p>
<p class="large">She heard the westering waters change and chime;</p>
<p>She heard the distant tumult of her arms</p>
<p class="large b">Defeated, not by courage, but by Time.</p>

<p>Knowledge had made a deadlier pact with death,</p>
<p class="large">Nor strength nor steel availed against that bond:</p>
<p>Slowly approached&mdash;and Britain held her breath&mdash;</p>
<p class="large b">The battle booming from the deeps beyond.</p>

<p>O, then what darkness rolled upon the wind,</p>
<p class="large">Threatening the torch that Britain held on high?</p>
<p>Where all her navies, baffled, broken, blind,</p>
<p class="large">Slunk backward, snarling in their agony!</p>
<p class="large"><i>Who guards the gates of Freedom now?</i> The cry</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>Stabbed heaven! <i>England, the shattered ramparts fall!</i></p>
<p class="large">Then, like a trumpet shivering through the sky</p>
<p>O, like white lightning rending the black pall</p>
<p class="b">Of heaven, an answer pealed: <i>Her dead shall hear that call.</i></p>

<p>Then came a distant light of great waves breaking</p>
<p class="large">That brought the sunset on each crumbling crest,</p>
<p>A rumour as of buried ages waking,</p>
<p class="large">And mighty spirits rising from their rest;</p>
<p class="large">Then ghostly clouds arose, with billowing breast,</p>
<p>White clouds that turned to sails upon their way,</p>
<p class="large">Red clouds that burned like flags against the West,</p>
<p>Till even the conquering fleet in silence lay</p>
<p class="b">Dazed with that strange old light, and night grew bright as day.</p>

<p><i>We come to fight for Freedom!</i> The great East</p>
<p class="large">Heard, and was rent asunder like a veil.</p>
<p>Host upon host out of the night increased</p>
<p class="large">Its towering clouds and crowded zones of sail:</p>
<p class="large"><i>England, our England, canst thou faint or fail?</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span><i>We come to fight for Freedom yet once more!</i></p>
<p class="large">This, this is ours at least! Count the great tale</p>
<p>Of all these dead that rise to guard thy shore</p>
<p class="b">By right of the red life they never feared to pour.</p>

<p><i>We come to fight for Freedom!</i> On they came,</p>
<p class="large">One cloud of beauty sweeping the wild sea;</p>
<p>And there, through all their thousands, flashed like flame</p>
<p class="large">That star-born signal of the Victory:</p>
<p class="large"><i>Duty</i>, that deathless lantern of the free;</p>
<p><i>Duty</i>, that makes a god of every man.</p>
<p class="large">And there was Nelson, watching silently</p>
<p>As through the phantom fleet the message ran;</p>
<p class="b">And his tall frigate rushed before the stormy van.</p>

<p>Nelson, our Nelson, frail and maimed and blind,</p>
<p class="large">Stretched out his dead cold face against the foe:</p>
<p>And England's Raleigh followed hard behind,</p>
<p class="large">With all his eager fighting heart aglow;</p>
<p class="large">Glad, glad for England's sake once more to know</p>
<p>The old joy of battle and contempt of pain;</p>
<p>Glad, glad to die, if England willed it so,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>The traitor's and the coward's death again;</p>
<p class="b">But hurl the world back now as once he hurled back Spain.</p>

<p>And there were all those others, Drake and Blake,</p>
<p class="large">Rodney and Howard, Byron, Collingwood;</p>
<p>With deathless eyes aflame for England's sake,</p>
<p class="large">As on their ancient decks they proudly stood,&mdash;</p>
<p class="large">Decks washed of old with England's purplest blood;</p>
<p>And there, once more, each rushing oaken side</p>
<p class="large">Bared its dark-throated, thirsty, gleaming brood</p>
<p>Of cannon, watched by laughing lads who died</p>
<p class="b">Long, long ago for England and her ancient pride.</p>

<p><i>We come to fight for England!</i> The great sea</p>
<p class="large">In a wild light of song began to break</p>
<p>Round that tall phantom of the Victory</p>
<p class="large">And all the foam was music in her wake:</p>
<p class="large">Ship after phantom ship, with guns a-rake</p>
<p>And shot-rent flags a-stream from every mast</p>
<p class="large">Moved in a deepening splendour, not to make</p>
<p>A shield for England of her own dead past;</p>
<p class="b">But, with a living dream to arm her soul at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span><i>We come to die for England</i>: through the hush</p>
<p class="large">Of gathered nations rose that regal cry,</p>
<p>From naked oaken walls one word could crush</p>
<p class="large">If those vast armoured throats dared to reply:</p>
<p class="large">But there the most implacable enemy</p>
<p>Felt his eyes fill with gladder, prouder tears,</p>
<p class="large">As Nelson's calm eternal face went by,</p>
<p>Gazing beyond all perishable fears</p>
<p class="b">To some diviner goal above the waste of years.</p>

<p>Through the hushed fleets the vision streamed away,</p>
<p class="large">Then slowly turned once more to that deep West,</p>
<p>While voices cried, O, England, the new day</p>
<p class="large b">Is dawning, but thy soul can take no rest.</p>

<p>Thy freedom and thy peace are only thine</p>
<p class="large">By right of toil on every land and sea</p>
<p>And by that crimson sacrificial wine</p>
<p class="large b">Of thine own heart and thine own agony.</p>

<p>Peace is not slumber. Peace, in every hour,</p>
<p class="large">Throbs like the heart of music. This alone</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>Can save thy heritage and confirm that power</p>
<p class="large b">Whereof the past is but the cushioned throne.</p>

<p>Look to the fleet! Again and yet again,</p>
<p class="large">Hear us who storm thy heart with this one cry.</p>
<p>Hear us, who cannot help, though fair and fain,</p>
<p class="large b">To hold thy seas before thee, and to die.</p>

<p>Look to the fleet! Thy fleet, the first, last line:</p>
<p class="large">The sword of Liberty, her strength, her shield,</p>
<p>Her food, her life-blood! Britain, it is thine,</p>
<p class="large b">Here, now, to hold that birth-right, or to yield.</p>

<p>So, through the dark, those phantom ships of old</p>
<p class="large">Faded, it seemed, through mists of blood and tears.</p>
<p>Sails turned to clouds, and slowly westward rolled</p>
<p class="large">The sad returning pageant of the years.</p>
<p>On tides of light, where all our tumults cease,</p>
<p class="large">Through that rich West, the Victory returned;</p>
<p>And all the waves around her whispered "peace,"</p>
<p class="large b">And from her mast no battle-message burned.</p>

<p>Like clouds, like fragments of those fading skies,</p>
<p class="large">The pageant passed, with all its misty spars,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>While the hushed nations raised their dreaming eyes</p>
<p class="large b">To that great light which brings the end of wars.</p>

<p>Ship after ship, in some strange glory drowned,</p>
<p class="large">Cloud after cloud, was lost in that deep light</p>
<p>Each with a sovran stillness haloed round.</p>
<p class="large">Then&mdash;that high fleet of stars led on the night.</p>

<div class="ml">
<p><span class="cap">U</span>NDER an arch of glorious leaves I passed</p>
<p>Out of the wood and saw the sickle moon</p>
<p class="b">Floating in daylight o'er the pale green sea.</p>

<p>It was the quiet hour before the sun</p>
<p>Gathers the clouds to prayer and silently</p>
<p>Utters his benediction on the waves</p>
<p>That whisper round the death-bed of the day.</p>
<p>The labourers were returning from the farms</p>
<p>And children danced to meet them. From the doors</p>
<p>Of cottages there came a pleasant clink</p>
<p>Where busy hands laid out the evening meal.</p>
<p>From smouldering elms around the village spire</p>
<p>There soared and sank the caw of gathering rooks.</p>
<p>The faint-flushed clouds were listening to the tale</p>
<p>The sea tells to the sunset with one sigh.</p>
<p>The last white wistful sea-bird sought for peace,</p>
<p>And the last fishing-boat stole o'er the bar,</p>
<p>And fragrant grasses, murmuring a prayer,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>Bowed all together to the holy west,</p>
<p>Bowed all together thro' the golden hush,</p>
<p>The breathing hush, the solemn scented hush,</p>
<p class="b">The holy, holy hush of eventide.</p>

<p>And, in among the ferns that crowned the hill</p>
<p>With waving green and whispers of the wind,</p>
<p>A boy and girl, carelessly linking hands,</p>
<p>Into their golden dream drifted away.</p>
<p>On that rich afternoon of scent and song</p>
<p>Old Michael Oaktree died. It was not much</p>
<p>He wished for; but indeed I think he longed</p>
<p>To see the light of summer once again</p>
<p>Blossoming o'er the far blue hills. I know</p>
<p>He used to like his rough-hewn wooden bench</p>
<p>Placed in the sun outside the cottage door</p>
<p>Where in the listening stillness he could hear,</p>
<p>Across the waving gilly-flowers that crowned</p>
<p>His crumbling garden wall, the long low sigh</p>
<p>Of supreme peace that whispers to the hills</p>
<p>The sacred consolation of the sea.</p>
<p>He did not hope for much: he longed to live</p>
<p>Until the winter came again, he said;</p>
<p class="b">But on the last sweet eve of May he died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>I wandered sadly through the dreaming lanes</p>
<p>Down to the cottage on that afternoon;</p>
<p>For I had known old Michael Oaktree now</p>
<p>So many years, so many happy years.</p>
<p>When I was little he had carried me</p>
<p>High on his back to see the harvest home,</p>
<p>And given me many a ride upon his wagon</p>
<p>Among the dusty scents of sun and hay.</p>
<p>He showed me how to snare the bulky trout</p>
<p>That lurked under the bank of yonder brook.</p>
<p>Indeed, he taught me many a country craft,</p>
<p>For I was apt to learn, and, as I learnt,</p>
<p>I loved the teacher of that homely lore.</p>
<p>Deep in my boyish heart he shared the glad</p>
<p>Influence of the suns and winds and waves,</p>
<p>Giving my childhood what it hungered for&mdash;</p>
<p class="b">The rude earth-wisdom of the primal man.</p>

<p>He had retained his childhood: Death for him</p>
<p>Had no more terror than his bed. He walked</p>
<p>With wind and sunlight like a brother, glad</p>
<p>Of their companionship and mutual aid.</p>
<p>We, toilers after truth, are weaned too soon</p>
<p>From earth's dark arms and naked barbarous breast.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>Too soon, too soon, we leave the golden feast,</p>
<p>Fetter the dancing limbs and pluck the crown</p>
<p>Of roses from the dreaming brow. We pass</p>
<p>Our lives in most laborious idleness.</p>
<p>For we have lost the meaning of the world;</p>
<p>We have gone out into the night too soon;</p>
<p>We have mistaken all the means of grace</p>
<p>And over-rated our small power to learn.</p>
<p>And the years move so swiftly over us:</p>
<p>We have so little time to live in worlds</p>
<p>Unrealised and unknown realms of joy,</p>
<p>We are so old before we learn how vain</p>
<p>Our effort was, how fruitlessly we cast</p>
<p>Our Bread upon the waters, and how weak</p>
<p>Our hearts were, but our chance desires how strong!</p>
<p>Then, in the dark, our sense of light decays;</p>
<p>We cannot cry to God as once we cried!</p>
<p>Lost in the gloom, our faith, perhaps our love,</p>
<p class="b">Lies dead with years that never can return.</p>

<p>But Michael Oaktree was a man whose love</p>
<p>Had never waned through all his eighty years.</p>
<p>His faith was hardly faith. He seemed a part</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>Of all that he believed in. He had lived</p>
<p>In constant conversation with the sun,</p>
<p>The wind, the silence and the heart of peace;</p>
<p>In absolute communion with the Power</p>
<p>That rules all action and all tides of thought,</p>
<p>And all the secret courses of the stars;</p>
<p>The Power that still establishes on earth</p>
<p>Desire and worship, through the radiant laws</p>
<p>Of Duty, Love and Beauty; for through these</p>
<p>As through three portals of the self-same gate</p>
<p>The soul of man attains infinity,</p>
<p>And enters into Godhead. So he gained</p>
<p>On earth a fore-taste of Nirvana, not</p>
<p>The void of eastern dream, but the desire</p>
<p>And goal of all of us, whether thro' lives</p>
<p>Innumerable, by slow degrees, we near</p>
<p>The death divine, or from this breaking body</p>
<p>Of earthly death we flash at once to God.</p>
<p>Through simple love and simple faith, this man</p>
<p class="b">Attained a height above the hope of kings.</p>

<p>Yet, as I softly shut the little gate</p>
<p>And walked across the garden, all the scents</p>
<p>Of mingling blossom ached like inmost pain</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>Deep in my heart, I know not why. They seemed</p>
<p>Distinct, distinct as distant evening bells</p>
<p>Tolling, over the sea, a secret chime</p>
<p>That breaks and breaks and breaks upon the heart</p>
<p>In sorrow rather than in sound, a chime</p>
<p>Strange as a streak of sunset to the moon,</p>
<p>Strange as a rose upon a starlit grave,</p>
<p>Strange as a smile upon a dead man's lips;</p>
<p>A chime of melancholy, mute as death</p>
<p>But strong as love, uttered in plangent tones</p>
<p>Of honeysuckle, jasmine, gilly-flowers,</p>
<p>Jonquils and aromatic musky leaves,</p>
<p class="b">Lilac and lilies to the rose-wreathed porch.</p>

<p>At last I tapped and entered and was drawn</p>
<p>Into the bedroom of the dying man,</p>
<p>Who lay, propped up with pillows, quietly</p>
<p>Gazing; for through his open casement far</p>
<p>Beyond the whispers of the gilly-flowers</p>
<p>He saw the mellow light of eventide</p>
<p>Hallow the west once more; and, as he gazed,</p>
<p>I think I never saw so great a peace</p>
<p>On any human face. There was no sound</p>
<p>Except the slumbrous pulsing of a clock,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>The whisper of the garden and, far off,</p>
<p class="b">The sacred consolation of the sea.</p>

<p>His wife sat at his bed-side: she had passed</p>
<p>Her eightieth year; her only child was dead.</p>
<p>She had been wedded more than sixty years,</p>
<p>And she sat gazing with the man she loved</p>
<p class="b">Quietly, out into that unknown Deep.</p>

<p>A butterfly floated into the room</p>
<p>And back again, pausing awhile to bask</p>
<p>And wink its painted fans on the warm sill;</p>
<p>A bird piped in the roses and there came</p>
<p>Into the childless mother's ears a sound</p>
<p class="b">Of happy laughing children, far away.</p>

<p>Then Michael Oaktree took his wife's thin hand</p>
<p>Between his big rough hands. His eyes grew dark,</p>
<p>And, as he turned to her and died, he spoke</p>
<p class="b">Two words of perfect faith and love&mdash;<i>Come soon</i>!</p>

<p>O then in all the world there was no sound</p>
<p>Except the slumbrous pulsing of a clock,</p>
<p>The whisper of the leaves and far away,</p>
<p>The infinite compassion of the sea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>But, as I softly passed out of the porch</p>
<p>And walked across the garden, all the scents</p>
<p>Of mingling blossoms ached like inmost joy,</p>
<p>Distinct no more, but like one heavenly choir</p>
<p>Pealing one mystic music, still and strange</p>
<p>As voices of the holy Seraphim,</p>
<p>One voice of adoration, mute as love,</p>
<p>Stronger than death, and pure with wedded tones</p>
<p>Of honeysuckle, jasmine, gilly-flowers,</p>
<p>Jonquils and aromatic musky leaves,</p>
<p class="b">Lilac and lilies to the garden gate.</p>

<p>O then indeed I knew how closely knit</p>
<p>To stars and flowers we are, how many means</p>
<p>Of grace there are for those that never lose</p>
<p>Their sense of membership in this divine</p>
<p>Body of God; for those that all their days</p>
<p>Have walked in quiet communion with the Life</p>
<p>That keeps the common secret of the sun,</p>
<p>The wind, the silence and the heart of man.</p>
<p>There is one God, one Love, one everlasting</p>
<p>Mystery of Incarnation, one creative</p>
<p class="b">Passion behind the many-coloured veil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>We have obscured God's face with partial truths,</p>
<p>The cause of all our sorrow and sin, our wars</p>
<p>Of force and thought, in this unheavened world.</p>
<p>Yet, by the battle of our partial truths,</p>
<p>The past against the present and the swift</p>
<p>Moment of passing joy against the deep</p>
<p>Eternal love, ever the weaker truth</p>
<p>Falls to the stronger, till once more we near</p>
<p>The enfolding splendour of the whole. Our God</p>
<p>Has been too long a partial God. We are all</p>
<p>Made in His image, men and birds and beasts,</p>
<p>Mountains and clouds and cataracts and suns,</p>
<p>With those great Beings above our little world,</p>
<p>A height beyond for every depth below,</p>
<p>Those long-forgotten Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,</p>
<p>Existences that live and move in realms</p>
<p>As far beyond our thought as Europe lies</p>
<p>With all its little arts and sciences</p>
<p>Beyond the comprehension of the worm.</p>
<p>We are all partial images, we need</p>
<p>What lies beyond us to complete our souls;</p>
<p>Therefore our souls are filled with a desire</p>
<p>And love which lead us towards the Infinity</p>
<p class="b">Of Godhead that awaits us each and all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>Peacefully through the dreaming lanes I went.</p>
<p>The sun sank, and the birds were hushed. The stars</p>
<p>Trembled like blossoms in the purple trees.</p>
<p>But, as I paused upon the whispering hill</p>
<p>The mellow light still lingered in the west,</p>
<p>And dark and soft against that rosy depth</p>
<p>A boy and girl stood knee-deep in the ferns.</p>
<p>Dreams of the dead man's youth were in my heart,</p>
<p>Yet I was very glad; and as the moon</p>
<p>Brightened, they kissed; and, linking hand in hand,</p>
<p class="b">Down to their lamp-lit home drifted away.</p>

<p>Under an arch of leaves, into the gloom</p>
<p>I went along the little woodland road,</p>
<p>And through the breathless hedge of hawthorn heard</p>
<p>Out of the deepening night, the long low sigh</p>
<p>Of supreme peace that whispers to the hills</p>
<p>The sacrament and sabbath of the sea.</p>

<div class="ml">
<p><span class="cap">"I</span> WANT to be new," said the duckling.</p>
<p class="large">"O, ho!" said the wise old owl,</p>
<p>While the guinea-hen cluttered off chuckling</p>
<p class="large b">To tell all the rest of the fowl.</p>

<p>"I should like a more elegant figure,"</p>
<p class="large">That child of a duck went on.</p>
<p>"I should like to grow bigger and bigger,</p>
<p class="large b">Until I could swallow a swan.</p>

<p>"I <i>won't</i> be the bond slave of habit,</p>
<p class="large">I <i>won't</i> have these webs on my toes.</p>
<p>I want to run round like a rabbit,</p>
<p class="large b">A rabbit as red as a rose.</p>

<p>"I <i>don't</i> want to waddle like mother,</p>
<p class="large">Or quack like my silly old dad.</p>
<p>I want to be utterly other,</p>
<p class="large b">And <i>frightfully</i> modern and mad."</p>

<p>"Do you know," said the turkey, "you're quacking!</p>
<p class="larage">There's a fox creeping up thro' the rye;</p>

<p>"I won't," said the duckling. "I'll lift him</p>
<p class="large">A beautiful song, like a sheep;</p>

<p>Now the curious end of this fable,</p>
<p class="large">So far as the rest ascertained,</p>
<p>Though they searched from the barn to the stable,</p>
<p class="large b">Was that <i>only his feathers remained</i>.</p>

<p>So he <i>wasn't</i> the bond slave of habit,</p>

<p>And <i>perhaps</i> he runs round like a rabbit,</p>

<div class="ml">
<p><span class="cap">T</span>HE man who discovered the use of a chair,</p>
<p class="large"><i>Odds</i>&mdash;<i>bobs</i>&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent3"><i>What a wonderful man!</i></p>
<p>He used to sit down on it, tearing his hair,</p>
<p class="large">Till he thought of a highly original plan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>For years he had sat on his chair, like you,</p>
<p class="large"><i>Quite</i>&mdash;<i>still!</i></p>
<p class="indent3"><i>But his looks were grim</i></p>
<p>For he wished to be famous (as great men do)</p>
<p class="large b">And nobody ever would listen to him.</p>

<p>Now he went one night to a dinner of state</p>
<p class="large"><i>Hear! hear!</i></p>
<p class="indent3"><i>In the proud Guildhall!</i></p>
<p>And he sat on his chair, and he ate from a plate;</p>
<p class="large b">But nobody heard his opinions at all;</p>

<p>There were ten fat aldermen down for a speech</p>
<p class="large">(<i>Grouse! Grouse!</i></p>
<p class="indent3"><i>What a dreary bird!</i>)</p>
<p>With five fair minutes allotted to each,</p>
<p class="large b">But never a moment for <i>him</i> to be heard.</p>

<p>But, each being ready to talk, I suppose,</p>
<p class="large"><i>Order! Order!</i></p>
<p class="indent3">They cried, <i>for the Chair</i>!</p>
<p>And, much to their wonder, our friend arose</p>
<p class="large b">And fastened his eye on the eye of the Mayor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>"We have come," he said, "to the fourteenth course!</p>
<p class="large">"<i>High&mdash;time,</i></p>
<p class="indent3"><i>for the Chair</i>," he said.</p>
<p>Then, with both of his hands, and with all of his force,</p>
<p class="large b">He hurled his chair at the Lord Mayor's head.</p>

<p>It missed that head by the width of a hair.</p>
<p class="large"><i>Gee&mdash;whizz!</i></p>
<p class="indent3"><i>What a horrible squeak!</i></p>
<p>But it crashed through the big bay-window there</p>
<p class="large b">And smashed a bus into Wednesday week.</p>

<p>And the very next day, in the decorous Times</p>
<p class="large">(<i>Great&mdash;Guns&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="indent3"><i>How the headlines ran!</i>)</p>
<p>In spite of the kings and the wars and the crimes,</p>
<p class="large b">There were five full columns about that man.</p>

<p><i><span class="cap">W</span>HY do we make our music?</i></p>
<p class="large">Oh, blind dark strings reply:</p>
<p>Because we dwell in a strange land</p>
<p class="large">And remember a lost sky.</p>
<p>We ask no leaf of the laurel,</p>
<p class="large">We know what fame is worth;</p>
<p>But our songs break out of our winter</p>
<p class="large b">As the flowers break out on the earth.</p>

<p>And we dream of the unknown comrade,</p>
<p class="large">In the days when we lie dead,</p>
<p>Who shall open our book in the sunlight,</p>
<p class="large">And read, as ourselves have read,</p>
<p>On a lonely hill, by a firwood,</p>
<p class="large">With whispering seas below,</p>
<p>And murmur a song we made him</p>
<p class="large b">Ages and ages ago.</p>

<p>If making his may-time sweeter</p>
<p class="large">With dews of our own dead may,</p>
<p>One pulse of our own dead heart-strings</p>
<p class="large">Awake in his heart that day,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>We would pray for no richer guerdon,</p>
<p class="large">No praise from the careless throng;</p>
<p>For song is the cry of a lover</p>
<p class="large b">In quest of an answering song.</p>

<p>As a child might run to his elders</p>
<p class="large">With news of an opening flower</p>
<p>We should walk with our young companion</p>
<p class="large">And talk to his heart for an hour,</p>
<p>As once by my own green firwood,</p>
<p class="large">And once by a Western sea,</p>
<p>Thank God, my own good comrades</p>
<p class="large b">Have walked and talked with me.</p>

<p>Too mighty to make men sorrow,</p>
<p class="large">Too weak to heal their pain</p>
<p>(Though they that remember the hawthorn</p>
<p class="large">May find their heaven again),</p>
<p>We are moved by a deeper hunger;</p>
<p class="large">We are bound by a stronger cord;</p>
<p>For love is the heart of our music,</p>
<p class="large">And love is its one reward.</p>
